# Here we create a KPI view that calculates CAC and ROAS by day
# KPIs explained:
# CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):
#   Measures how much money is spent to acquire one customer.
#   Formula: total spend รท number of conversions.
#   Lower CAC means more efficient campaigns (cheaper cost per acquisition).
# ROAS (Return On Ad Spend):
#   Measures the revenue generated for each unit of money spent on ads.
#   Formula: revenue รท spend.
#   In this dataset, revenue is defined as conversions ร 100.
#   Higher ROAS means better returns from advertising investment.
